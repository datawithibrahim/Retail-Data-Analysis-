## 🧩 Project Workflow

### 1. Data Collection
- Imported data from **[source: CSV file / SQL database / public dataset / API]**  
- Verified data quality, structure, and schema before starting analysis  

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values and duplicates  
- Formatted column types and standardized date/time formats  
- Removed outliers and inconsistent records  

### 3. Data Transformation
- Created new calculated columns  
- Aggregated data for better readability  
- Applied filters and transformations for analysis-ready format  

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Performed descriptive statistics to understand data distribution  
- Visualized relationships using charts and plots  
- Identified correlations, seasonal trends, and key drivers of performance  

### 5. Visualization & Insights
- Designed interactive dashboards in **Power BI / Tableau**  
- Used **Python visualizations** (Matplotlib, Seaborn) for deeper analysis  
- Highlighted top-performing categories, segments, and metrics
